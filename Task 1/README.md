# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator (Beginner Project)

This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python. It performs simple arithmetic operations using clear and easy-to-understand variable names.

---

## 📌 Overview

The calculator allows users to:
- Add two numbers
- Subtract one number from another
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide one number by another (with divide-by-zero protection)

This project is great for students who are just starting with Python and want to learn about:
- User input
- Variables
- Arithmetic operators
- Conditional statements

## 🛠️ How to Run the Program

### Requirements
- Python 3 installed on your computer.

### Steps:
1. Save the code in a file named `calculator.py` (or any name you like).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where your file is saved.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python Calculator.py
````

## 💡 Example Output

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Choose an operation:
+ for Addition
- for Subtraction
* for Multiplication
/ for Division
Enter your choice (+, -, *, /): +

Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

Thank you for using the calculator!

## 📚 Concepts Used

* `input()` – to get input from the user
* `float()` – to convert strings to numbers
* `if-elif-else` – to perform different operations
* `print()` – to display results

---

## ✅ Why This is a Good Starter Project

* No advanced Python knowledge required
* Helps practice basic syntax and logic
* Easy to build and expand (add more operations or features)

---

## 🧠 Optional Ideas to Improve

If you want to improve this project, you can:

* Add a loop to allow multiple calculations
* Use functions to organize code better
* Validate inputs to ensure the user enters numbers
* Add more operations (like modulus `%`, power `**`, etc.)
