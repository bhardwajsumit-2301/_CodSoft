## 📚 What You’ll Learn

This project is ideal for Python beginners. You'll practice:

* Using Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules
* List operations and string joining
* Type conversion and exception handling
* Writing clean, readable, and reusable functions

## ⚠️ Password Requirements

* Minimum length: `4 characters`

  > This ensures there's room for at least one character from each required type (uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol).

If the user inputs fewer than 4, the script will return a helpful warning message.
